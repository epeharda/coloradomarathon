					<p>The Colorado Marathon is in its 14th year. Over the years we have donated over $120,000 to local and national charities and other beneficiaries. We partner with numerous beneficiaries every year in an effort to put on a great event. Our beneficiary groups provide necessary volunteers and other resources required to pull off an event of this size while earning money for their organization. It's simply a win-win partnership.</p>
